I've been using Terraform for work and found it to be really useful for infrastructure tasks. I published a repo of some of the things I'm working on [here](https://github.com/magicmicah/terraform_things).

It's mainly for OCI but I plan to expand to AWS, Azure, GCP. My future goal is to create templates that utilize as much Always Free resources as possible.
